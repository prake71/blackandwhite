# blackandwhite
Black And White is a 2D platformer "game" programmed for pyweek challenge #25

Master the two worlds where black becomes white, up becomes down and left
becomes right to reach the blue portals which are your milestones to a more
colorful world.

This is one of my messiest programs I ever written and/or pasted together.
Unfortunately I did not focus on the project as I planned. Nevertheless
I always tried to end the day's work with something which is somehow
consistent. The goal for me at the end was at least to publish something,
so I had to cut all features.

Everything can be controlled with cursor and space keys.
Use s to skip a level and r to reset player's position if got stuck.

Python 3.x necessary.
